The Event takes place on the ground floor of Fachhochschule Salzburg and is fully accessible without stairs or elevators.
Parking spaces are available.  You can reach us by train (S-Bahn S3, Station "Puch Urstein") or bus (Line 160, Station "Puch Urstein").
We do not charge any fees for LudeCat, and consequently cannot offer catering. There are some vending machines for snacks
and soft drinks at the venue. At past events Pizza Delivery was use extensively.
